# Hola mundo 👋

My name is Gerardo. I'm a PhD student in Bayesian Machine Learning at Queen Mary University of London.

- 🤖 I'm interested in bayesian machine learning and dynamical systems for quantitative finance
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about complex systems, causal networks, and neural Granger causality
