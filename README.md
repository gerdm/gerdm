# Hola mundo ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gerardo and I'm an Msc student in mathematics at Queen Mary University of London.

- ðŸ¤– I'm interested in bayesian machine learning and dynamical systems for quantitative finance
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about complex systems, causal networks, and neural Granger causality
- I'm working towards my master dissertation on [Kalman Filters](https://github.com/gerdm/msc-dissertation), and as a GSoC student working with the Python code of Kevin Murphy's second volume of his [Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective](https://github.com/gerdm/pyprobml) book
